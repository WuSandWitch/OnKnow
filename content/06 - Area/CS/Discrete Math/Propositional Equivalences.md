# Proposition Equivalences


Two proposition are equivalent if they always have same truth value.


## Tautologies, Contradictions, Contingencies


- tautology 
	- a proposition which is always true.
	- e.g. $p \lor \neg p$ 
- contradiction 
	- a proposition which is always false.
	- e.g. $p \land \neg p$
- contigency
	- which is neither tautology nor contradiction
	- e.g. $p$
