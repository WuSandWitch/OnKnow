# Access network


## Residential Access
### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
![[Pasted image 20240921161701.png]]

- Asymmetric Speed
	- 24-52 Mbps dedicated downstream transmission rate
	- 3.5-16 Mbps dedicated upstream transmission rate
- **Dedicated Access Network**

### Cable-based Access

- frequency division multiplexing (FDM): different channels transmitted in different frequency bands.
- HFC: hybrid fiber coax
	• asymmetric: up to 40 Mbps – 1.2 Gbs downstream transmission rate, 30-100 Mbps upstream transmission rate
- **Share Access Network**

### Difference Between
| Feature               | **Cable-Based Access**                                             | **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Infrastructure        | Coaxial cables + fiber optics                                      | Existing telephone lines (copper wires)                              |
| *Type of Connection*  | *Shared among users in the same area             *                 | *Dedicated line from home to ISP central office *                    |
| Bandwidth             | Higher download speeds (up to 1.2 Gbps), shared                    | Lower speeds (up to 52 Mbps), dependent on distance                  |
| Download/Upload Speed | Asymmetric: faster downloads, slower uploads                       | Asymmetric: slower than cable, but with dedicated access             |
| Impact of Usage       | Bandwidth shared with neighbors, potential slowdowns at peak times | No impact from neighbors, but speed decreases with distance from ISP |

### Wireless Access Networks
- **Shared wireless access network** connects devices (like smartphones, laptops) to an access point (e.g., a WiFi router) or a base station (for cellular networks).
- **802.11 (WiFi)** standards enable wireless local area networks, commonly used in homes and businesses for short-range, high-speed connections.
- **Cellular networks** offer wider coverage, such as 4G and 5G, providing mobile users with Internet access as they move.
