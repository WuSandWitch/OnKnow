# OnKnow

Hi, I'm Owen, a student studying in CS. \
And I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes.

OnKnow is my knowledge base site designed for sharing notes and articles built by [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). \
Unlike a blog, this platform serves as a repository basically the knowledge which ever stores or not in my brain.
